## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server

- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript types
- `node build-and-verify.js` - Build and verify the project

## Building and Deploying

### Recommended Deployment Method

We've provided several deployment options, but the recommended method is the direct deployment approach that resolves Git ownership issues:

```bash
# Run the direct deployment script:
.\direct-deploy.bat
```

This script:
- Works around Git "dubious ownership" errors
- Automatically detects your GitHub username
- Updates all project configurations
- Builds the project and deploys to GitHub Pages
- Provides detailed logs

### Additional Deployment Options

If you encounter issues with the direct deployment, we've provided alternative approaches:

**Option 1: Fix Git Ownership then Deploy**
```bash
# First, fix Git ownership issues:
.\fix-git-ownership.bat

# Then run the enhanced deployment:
.\enhanced-one-click-deploy.bat
```

**Option 2: Original Deployment Scripts**
These scripts may work on systems not affected by Git ownership issues:
```bash
.\one-click-deploy.bat
# or
.\auto-deploy-silent.bat
```

### Solving the "Dubious Ownership" Error

If you encounter Git "dubious ownership" errors during deployment, please see:
- [GIT_OWNERSHIP_FIX_GUIDE.md](./GIT_OWNERSHIP_FIX_GUIDE.md) - Complete solution to Git ownership issues
